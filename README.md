## Lessons Learned

This project was very interesting thanks to the Chrome Extension API.
Uniquely, almost every call to the API is done asynceronously.
Initially, I struggled because I am used to synchronous programming and using asyncronous programming at my leisure.
Using this API, I would adapted to this more asynchronous-mode of thinking.

This project was unique for me due to the lack of online resources to go to.
There does not seem to be a strong chrome extensions community online, so you are forced to explore and deal with your problems on your own.
