# Pomodoro Timer

Pomodoro Timer is a time management assistant for Chrome that follows the Pomodoro Technique. It intends to improve productivity and focus by taking short 5-minute breaks. It can be used for studying, reading, writing, cooking or simply concentrating on something important. I created it as a project for Harvard CS50.
